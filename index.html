                This is a space where I plan to shitpost alongside other shenanigans. Maybe it would be cool to write blogposts or something but at the moment who knows what is going on.</span>
            <br>
                <span>I digress; Some topics I enjoy include:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mathematics</li>
                    <li>Programming</li>
                    <li>Enthusiast Cars</li>
                    <li>Computer Science</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                    <li>Science & Technology</li>
                </ul>
                Let's talk about discrete versus continuous mathematics. I believe the discrete mathematics are the most valid form of mathematics due to the relative simplicity and ease of understanding that discrete math provides. Continuous math (and specifically the set of real numbers) is particularly annoying due to the need to prove for units of arbitrary precision. Topology scares me for this reason. Mathematicians in general also scare me.

                On another note, I think the current state of compliance with the average person's relationship with electronics is scary. Changing laws is too much to expect, but people need to exercise more self control with regards to what technology they will let in their life.
